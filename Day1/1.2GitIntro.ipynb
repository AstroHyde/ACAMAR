    "#### What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A program you run from the command line\n",
    "- A distributed version control system\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers use Git so that they can keep the history of all the changes to their code. This means that they can rollback changes (or switch to older versions) as far back int time as they started using Git on their project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A codebase in Git is referred to as a **repository**, or **repo**, for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the principal developer of Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Github](https://github.com/) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hosting service for Git repositories\n",
    "- A web interface to explore Git repositories\n",
    "- A social network of programmers\n",
    "- We all have individual accounts and put our codebases on our Github account\n",
    "- You can follow users and star your favorite projects\n",
    "- Developers can access codebases on other public accounts\n",
    "- GitHub uses Git\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can you use git without Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about this quote: “Git is software. GitHub is a company that happens to use Git software.”  So yes, you can certainly use Git without GitHub!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your local repository consists of three \"trees\" maintained by Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working Directory**: which holds the actual files.\n",
    "- **Index**: which acts as a staging area\n",
    "- **HEAD**: which points to the last commit you've made.\n",

    "#### Pushing to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to send files from our local machine to our remote repository on Github, we need to use the command `git push`. However, you also need to add the name of the remote, in this case we called it `origin` and the name of the branch, in this case `master`.\n",
